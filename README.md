# ForestFireDeepLearning
Identify Images of Forests that have Fire or not using Neural Networks. Using the data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohnishsaiprasad/forest-fire-images#.
The data is downloaded and unzipped, then into the users google drive to extract the images.
The data is preprosessed, split into a training ,testing and a validations set. 
A simple neural netwrok is created, which we improve by fine tuning hyperparameters, the use of different techniques such as Normalisation, regularisations and Dropouts.
A Fully connected Convolution Neural Network is also created which coneetes to the fined tuned neural network created.
There is also a Application of ResNet50.
